Json Output
-----------

The Json Output generated for the template file will have 3 key/value pairs:
    -> 'fields': which will be dictionary with many dictionaries, each one will
        have a key which is the column name, and the values will be dictionaries which will have 3 fields:
            -> 'type': which will be the type of value in this column
            -> 'column_letter': which will be the excel letter equivalent of the number of the column.

    -> 'header_row': A string representation of the row number which will have all the column headers
    -> 'header_list': A list which contains all the names of the rows from the template file, in the order that they
     are in the file.
    -> 'row_template': which will be a dictionary with all the names of the column headers as keys,
     and they will all point to null

    -> See sample_template.json for an example of a file that will be generated for sample_template.xlsx

The Json Output will have all the column headers in lower case and all the white spaces replaced with '_'
